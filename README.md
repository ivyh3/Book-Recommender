# Book-Recommender
With the rise of social media, the internet and video games, it seems like nowadays, many
people are choosing other hobbies over reading. For instance, research from The Reading
Agency has shown that 50% of adults in the UK don’t read regularly as a hobby. Their survey
conducted showed that the primary challenges to reading included a lack of time, difficulty
in focusing attention, and difficulty in choosing titles to read (The Reading Agency). Our
goal is to address these problems by quickly helping people choose a book and tailoring
the book to their interests to improve concentration. Our project question is, How can
we recommend new books to people based on their preferred genres and star
ratings? To do this, our program will narrow down a dataset of books to 10 titles based on
the user’s preferences. The user states their preferred genres from the given list and inputs
their minimum star rating in the Python console. The recommended books are based on
how many genres overlap with the user input as well as how high their star rating is.
